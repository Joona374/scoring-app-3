## 📋 Overview

This application helps hockey coaches track scoring chances (not just goals) to get a more complete picture of team and player performance. This tool can be used to uncover strengths and weaknesses beyond traditional statistics both at team and individual player levels.

### Key Features

- **Video-Based Game Tagging** — Review game footage and tag scoring chances efficiently and informatively
- **Excel Export** — Generate detailed reports for deeper analysis
- **Team Dashboard** — Season overview with filtering by game range
- **Zone Visualization** — Heat maps showing where shots and chances come from (ice zones) and where they go (net zones)
- **Player Analytics** — Individual player stats with plus/minus tracking for both goals and chances
- **Multi-user Support** — Multiple coaches can collaborate on the same team
- **Roster Scraper** — Automatically fetch game rosters from Finnish Ice-Hockey Federation website (Playwright)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 19** with Vite
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Custom CSS** (no UI framework — intentional choice for learning)
- **Canvas API** for zone map visualizations
- **localStorage** caching for instant dashboard loads

### Backend
- **FastAPI** (Python)
- **SQLAlchemy 2.0** with typed models
- **Pydantic** for request/response validation
- **JWT Authentication** (python-jose + bcrypt)
- **Alembic** for database migrations
- **Playwright** for web scraping game rosters

### Infrastructure
- **Frontend**: Vercel
- **Backend**: Render (free tier with cold starts)
- **Database**: Neon (serverless PostgreSQL)

## 📊 Database Schema

The application uses a relational model with 12+ tables including:

- `users` / `teams` — Multi-tenant team management
- `players` / `games` — Roster and schedule tracking  
- `player_stats_tags` — Individual scoring chance events with ice position, net position, shot type, and result
- `team_stats_tags` — Team-level play pattern tracking (rushes, power plays, faceoffs, etc.)
- Junction tables for tracking which players were on-ice or participating in each event

## 📈 Project History

This project started to solve a personal need. I work as a coach for a hockey team, and wanted better tools to analyze our games. The first two versions were built just for our team.

| Version | Year | Stack | Lessons Learned |
|---------|------|-------|-----------------|
| 1.0 | 2023 | Python + Tkinter | Started with nearly zero experience, ended up with a working but completely unmaintainable desktop app |
| 2.0 | 2024 | Python + PyQt | Lessons learned and applied about maintainability. Destop app distribution was a huge challenge and every update was a gamble |
| 3.0 | 2025 | React + FastAPI | Web-based = accessible anywhere, easy updates. Has so far offered great full-stack development experience |

The decision to rebuild as a web app solved the core usability issues and opened the door to multi-user collaboration. Now 3 teams use it.

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Productize as a paid SaaS for hockey teams
- Add goalie-specific statistics tracking
- Mobile/Tablet-optimized tagging interface
- Build additional software for live tagging (timestamps) syncable with video footage
